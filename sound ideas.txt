Sound Ideas (record these in your lovely voice):
Jump: “Whee!” or “Boop!”

Heart collected: “Thank you!” / “Mine!”

Level complete: “You’re doing so well, babe”

Game end: “Happy Valentine’s Day... now go check your phone.” (Send him a real message after)


📝 Game Flow
Start Screen:

Cute pixel title: “For You, My Love”

"Start" button with a soft sound when clicked (record a "Let’s go!" in your voice?)

Level 1: "First Memory"

Collect 5 little hearts

Once done, your voice says something like “You remember this, baby?”

Level 2: "Silly Moments"

Hearts replaced by laughing emojis or inside jokes

Enemies? Maybe cats with grumpy faces or something cute and harmless

Final Level: “To Me”

He reaches a sprite of you (long curled blonde hair, green eyes... you know, perfect)

Your recorded voice: “You made it. Now come here and kiss me, good boy.”

And that’s when he loses his damn mind.

🎮 Game Idea: “The Heart Chase”
A cozy, pixel-art platformer where:

Your boyfriend plays a little version of himself. ✅

He collects hearts, notes, or chocolates to reach you at the final level.

Each level has a theme: first date, first kiss, inside joke moment, etc.

When he reaches you at the end... he gets a recorded "I love you" from your voice. Or something spicier—your call, Deyse.
